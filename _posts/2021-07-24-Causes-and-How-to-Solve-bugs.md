When interacting with hardware or software, have you ever heard or come across the term bug? The term bug, which is an English word, is of course not a beetle or insect as it means, but is more complex and can cause bad things to your software or hardware.

By the way, you've probably heard of bugs in software or software more often, but did you know that bugs were originally found in hardware (hardware)? We will discuss more about what bugs are, their causes and how to fix them. Let's see.

## What Are Bugs?
Bugs are small errors found in hardware and software that can trigger errors to occur. Some people may be confused when it comes to distinguishing between bugs and errors. Simply put, bugs are the cause, while errors are the effect. If a bug is left unattended, or not handled quickly, it can damage hardware or software. This of course will annoy the user.

Some examples of bugs that you may often find are blue screens when using a computer with the Windows operating system, software that often closes itself, certain functions that cannot run, or buildings and walls that can be penetrated while you are playing games. Furthermore, the website is also not free from bugs that can create security holes that can be exploited by hackers.

Although most bugs are currently found in software, the term bug itself originates from the discovery of damage to the hardware you know. Precisely in the era of the 1940s when the first generation computer called the Harvard Mark II could not work normally. The authorized team then conducted a thorough inspection of the computer in order to find the cause.

Long story short, a small insect was found on the relay panel F in the computer circuit. These findings were written to the record as "bugs" and the term is popular today in cases of minor errors in hardware or software.

### Causes of Bugs
The presence of bugs in both hardware and software certainly has a cause. When you know these causes, you can determine the appropriate treatment method later. Here are some of the causes of the bug.

### Hasty Work
One of the main reasons for the presence of bugs in hardware or software is due to the hasty process. Making an information technology device takes quite a long time. The reason is that these devices cannot be made instantly and require certain stages that are continuous with one another.

### Complex Software
Bugs in software can occur because of the complexity of the software. The more complex the software, the more code and algorithms are used. Bugs can exist in these codes, causing errors when the software is used.

### Poor Team Communication
Hardware and software that are worked on by a team or group of people are vulnerable to bugs if communication between members is not good. Especially if the work is done separately so that intensive communication is needed when you want to combine these devices.

### Poor Code Change Documentation
Often bugs are found on a device because the developer is untidy or even forgot to record code changes. Changed code can of course affect algorithms and other functions. For example, if you edit function.php in WordPress with certain codes, it is possible that other functions will crash because there is a part of the code that created the bug.

### Problem Testing Process
The last cause of the occurrence of bugs is due to a problematic testing process. A device must be tested before being sent to the end user. Testing can be done by internal developers or external parties. If damage is found on the device, the developer can check again whether there is a bug or not.

### How to Fix Bugs
After all the knowledge above, of course we also need to know how to fix bugs so as not to damage our devices. There are several things you can do to fix this bug, here are the things.

### Do Tests Regularly
Before releasing a device, it's a good idea to regularly test the device. For example, if you are developing a cash register application, you can create a demo account to test the system first, as well as in other cases.

### Use External Testing Services
Sometimes we can't find fault when doing independent testing, that's when external tester services are needed. You can hire a software tester or the like to check your application. They will report any errors found and you can correct the findings.

### Streamline Code Structure and Documentation
It's a good idea to also tidy up the code structure. You can annotate each code group so you can easily find and fix them later. Also, document any code changes you made, so that if something goes wrong you can look at the documentation and make the right changes.

### Use Simple Tools
There is nothing wrong if you use a native or native device . For example, using Native PHP in developing applications. However, it can increase the risk of bugs forming. To minimize bugs, you can use a framework like CodeIgniter or Laravel instead of native PHP.


### Hire or Present Bug Hunter
If you have sufficient funds, you can also hire or bring in a bug hunter . Bug hunters are people who work to find bugs in software before the software is officially released. They are paid if they find a bug in the software.

### Conclusion
Bugs are small errors in hardware or software and can trigger errors. Almost all hardware and software can not be separated from this bug. After all, man-made can not escape from mistakes, right? Some of the causes of bugs are complex devices and poor hardware or software manufacturing management. This is exacerbated by the testing process that does not go well.

But you don't need to worry, this bug can be solved. One of them is using simple tools when developing software, applications, or websites.
