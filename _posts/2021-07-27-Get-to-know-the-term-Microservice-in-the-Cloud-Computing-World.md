In the development of the IT world, microservices are a hot topic and are being discussed a lot. This is not without reason, because it provides great benefits to users, making services easier and more efficient.

By using microservices, you can easily change the code in the service in the application, so that business and business services can be managed. It can also provide a good opportunity for the company to provide services more regularly and regularly.

**Those of** you who are interested in using **microservices in the world of cloud computing** should know more complete information about them. That way, you can take full advantage of these microservice features, thus providing significant constructive changes.

## Complete Explanation of Microservice
To learn microservices, it's a good idea to start from monolithic. In the microservice process, the services within an application are shared in such a way that it results in smaller and more detailed relationships. Later this pattern change will affect the relationship between the application and the database.

In contrast to monolithic systems, services using microservices will divide the database schema into several parts. Later each service will be created with its own database, so that the programming language used will be in accordance with the needs of the database.

Although divided into several parts, each service in the microservice will remain connected to each other. The technology used for these services can also be different, depending on the needs of the user.

If you want to apply **microservices in the world of cloud computing**, especially if you want to put it on a certain platform, it cannot be used directly. You must first create an API gateway, so that each system can act as it functions. There are several tasks to be performed by the API gateway system, including:

Perform load balancing .
Perform caching on data and systems.
Able to perform access control to all services and applications.
Perform monitoring and API metering.
Advantages of Using Microservice
Microservice is superior to other systems, especially monolithic. It is more secure and reliable , and has a fairly stable scale. The following are the advantages that you will get by using microservices, including:

1. Stand-alone Service
In contrast to a monolithic system with one database, a microservice system provides services between servers and databases in one system. So that each service or service can stand alone without the help of other services.

2. Easier to Set Up
For those of you who don't have much free time to make repairs and system settings, then using microservices in the world of cloud computing can make your work easier. It is much easier to set up, because the maintenance process is quite easy and can be adjusted as needed.

3. Not Limited to Certain Technologies
When you use microservices, you can still use new technologies that will appear in the future. Even though it uses an API gateway, it can still be applied not only on the Android platform, but also on iOS and websites in various browsers.

4. Service can be Expanded
When running a business, you certainly need a development team to maximize the work of each system and its parts. By using microservices, you can enable them to develop their own services, without interfering with other services.

These advantages can certainly be a consideration for those of you who want to install microservices in the world of cloud computing . You don't need to hesitate anymore to use it, especially if each part of the service requires different development.

## Disadvantages in Using Microservice
Although it has advantages that are sufficient to help the service process in servers or applications, it does not mean that microservices do not have disadvantages. You have to know the shortcomings, so that you can cover these shortcomings with servers or other supporting platforms. The following are the disadvantages of microservices, including:

1. Changing Entity
When an entity in a database is changed, other entities must also be changed to make the process work uninterrupted. Therefore, during the use of microservices, you must run them carefully to avoid errors.

2. Difficult to Implement Service Changes
If you want to make a design change, the service may be difficult to change in some cases. This makes you need to carefully research the application that wants to use microservices, because it requires complex calculations and development.

To use a microservice, you must know the runtime you want to use. Development and configuration of existing programs. That way, you can use it according to your needs and application development.

That's the information about microservices in the world of cloud computing that you need to know. Hopefully this information can help you, especially those who want to add these features in applications or service media owned in the field of computerization.
