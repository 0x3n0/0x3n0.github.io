Web-based applications have long been used in the world of computing . The use of applications will basically make it easier to complete human work. For its manufacture can not be separated from a computer and several things around it.

When HTML began to appear hosting providers were still quite limited to a few government agencies and universities. Soon a programming language emerged that helped a web become more dynamic. There is also a web hosting that can help you install the source code and configure the database .

After that, things related to virtual private servers or VPS kept popping up. Human interaction with servers is decreasing day by day. From this, a hosting provider emerged that provides services to accommodate source code and handle server problems, which are called serverless in cloud computing .

Serverless concept began to be used by several major vendors as the latest technology concept. This is an ease to deal with the previous technology. In this case there are several terms or terms specifically used to help you better understand the meaning of these terms.

## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a combination of the use of computers and Internet-based development. In language, it is often interpreted as cloud computing. The cloud in question is a metaphor for the internet like a cloud which is often depicted in a diagram for a computer network.

This term is a period where computers become a technology that is highly utilized with the help of the internet and the like. At this time the concept of serverless is used to fulfill the real purpose. Serverless in Cloud computing is quite in line with each other. 

## Serverless
The serverless architecture doesn't mean you don't use a server at all. Because it is impossible that all client server concepts do not require a server. Unless you want to present client to client but this is still inefficient without a server at all.

Serverless in cloud computing can develop web applications using minimal configuration. Less referred to in this term does not mean nothing at all. This means more referring to the reduction of the server in question. If you want to deploy serverless applicationsthen you don't need to interact a lot via avenues such as SSH orotherremote connections .

You have been facilitated by the web-based console provided by the service provider. For example, when you deploy a code that is connected to a proxy , you don't have to fiddle with the configuration of the web server . For serverless in cloud computing , you can choose which code to execute.

## Main Attention
Serverless architecture has main attention to several important points that support this concept. First there is availability which means the service is available within 24 hours without any downs except for errors when deploying code. Next is scalability, which means that scaling can be done when there is a spike in visitors and resource usage .

Service integration is also a major concern in this concept where all existing services at this service provider can be used. There is also a minimal deployment on serverless in cloud computing which is a minimal configuration without entering the core settings.

Cost reduction is also a major concern in reducing costs to manage infrastructure independently. Next there is manageable where this concept can be managed easily and quickly through an easy-to-use console for the convenience of all parties.

Another major concern also focuses on monitoring without being limited to looking at resource usage via the CLI. Some of these important points are the main concern for serverless in cloud computing as the basic concept that becomes the identity of it. Some of these things become the integrity of this concept.

## Service
In this concept there are several special services offered to meet the intent of each user. The services consist of:

- Databases , (AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database , IBM Cloudant )
- Function as a service, (AWS Lambda, Azure Function, Google Cloud Function, IBM Openwhisk)
- Notification , (AWS SNS, Azure Notification Hub)
- Storage , (AWS S3, AWS Glacier, Azure Blob Storage )
- Data lake , (AWS Data Lake, Azure Data Lake )
- Message queue , (AWS SQS, Azure Service Bus Queue )
- Stream , (AWS Kinesis Stream, Azure Event Hub)
- Machine learning, (AWS Machine Learning, Azure Machine Learning)

## Vendor
This concept can be presented directly by a special vendor. Vendors that provide serverless architecture services in cloud computing include:

- Microsoft Azure
- Amazon Web Services
- Google Cloud
- IBM

The conclusion is that the concept of serverless in cloud computing is a type of architecture that was in the period of using computers with several databases and special programming languages. This concept has a special service with several things that are the center of attention in this concept.
