If you are interested in using cloud computing services , here are details about the types of services available so far. All of them are services that are flexible, accessible, and can be accessed on a large scale.

## Cloud Type Based on Owned Network
The scope and nature of cloud services can be grouped based on the reach they have, divided into several parts, including public, private, community and hybrid services. The following is information related to the full service to make it easier for you to distinguish between them.

1. Hybrid Service
Is a type of service from various combinations of other clouds, both public, private, and community types. Although it can stand alone, it can still be combined with other inter-cloud applications if needed.

It can be a combination of two cloud services, or all three at once. Those who use hybrid services usually want to take advantage of certain benefits that the service has, either its storage model or its more flexible access.

2. Community Service
Is a type of cloud computing service that can be accessed simultaneously by several organizations or companies, of course, it still has the same level of importance and equal security. By using community services, the stored data remains safe even if access is carried out simultaneously.

Those who use community-specific cloud services usually have the same goal or vision. In addition to being accessed simultaneously, the management can also be done jointly, either by the company or organization or from a third party.

3. Private Service
It is a special cloud service to be used for one particular organization or company, so it will not be accessible to other users. It cannot be accessed by just anyone, and is not as open as cloud services to the public.

Companies that own private cloud services have considerable control over their use, access, or management. Not only that, the company or organization can also manage the software and hardware used, so that it is completely exclusive.

4. Public Service
The last type of cloud computing service is the type of public service, which is a storage service that can be accessed in general. Customers, employees who work in the company, as well as officials and owners of the company can access the services available in their storage.

If using public services, the resources are distributed evenly, both for data storage, the network that is accessed and its use, even though each person who accesses it is a different user. Public services are generally used by vendors or large companies, such as Google or Microsoft.

In addition to dividing it into service types based on its reach, cloud computing types are also divided into the types of services provided. To make it easier to distinguish and choose which one is the best to use, here are brief details that will help you.

2. IaaS Model model
The cloud computing service model used for the IaaS model is quite unique, where it has a complete service package. Starting from the hardware used as a virtual computer media, IP addresses, bandwidth and others.

3. Daas Model
It is a cloud data storage model that can be used remotely, so you can access it anytime without any restrictions. To use it, you only need to pay for storage according to the resources used.

4. Saas Model
