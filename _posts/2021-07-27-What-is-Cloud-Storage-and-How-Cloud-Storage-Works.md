**How cloud storage works is** very important to know. That's because, its existence becomes very vital in the midst of a society that continues to develop. Actually, the existence of this novelty is related to the process of storing and sending files. Previously, sending and storing files seemed complicated.

That's because, it takes hardware as a medium. The hardware itself such as flash and hard disk. The existence of both can be said to be enough to facilitate some activities. However, without flash and hard disk, storage and sending of these files cannot be done.

In today's era, the function of both has greatly decreased. That's because, storing and sending files can be done without the presence of hardware. You could say, the **way cloud storage works** is very easy for this activity. To understand it, let's discuss in detail the meaning first.

## The following is the definition of cloud storage
Understanding is the first thing that needs to be understood. Without understanding the meaning, it is difficult to know how it works thoroughly. If it needs to be explained, cloud storage itself is actually an online-based storage media. With that, an internet connection is needed when you want to access the files in it.

Actually, the existence of this media is still very new. However, because of the convenience it provides, the number of fans is growing rapidly. Actually, to understand this convenience, it is necessary to know how cloud storage works in detail. But to make things easier, let's make a comparison.

Previously, the file storage process was done offline. Because it is done offline, hardware is needed to store it. Hardware durability certainly has a time limit. Therefore, the file will also be damaged if the device is also damaged. Different conditions will be seen when cloud storage is used.

Files will not be saved on personal devices. However, the file will be stored on the server computer. The server computer itself will be managed by the provider. Of course, the provider already understands in detail how to perform hardware maintenance. With it, file security becomes more guaranteed.

## The advantages it has are extraordinary
This security is not the only reason why this medium is in great demand. It has other advantages. One of the most important relates to the presence of viruses. Viruses are a big problem that people often face. When the virus attacks, the files will be corrupt and unusable.

When using a flash, the possibility of getting a virus becomes greater. That's because, flash will be used on many computers with different levels of security. Different conditions will clearly appear when using cloud storage. When stored there, virus problems can be avoided entirely.

That's because, the provider definitely provides a high level of security from these problems. Another advantage will also be seen in the ease of access. Storage using hardware has limited access. That's because, only a few types of devices can be used.

For example, let's see when using a flash. If the flash is used, the file can only be opened on devices that have the ability to access the flash. If the device is not compatible, access is not possible. The way cloud storage works is much different.

When in use, the type of device does not need to be considered. That's because, access is done using the internet in full. As long as a device has an internet connection, the device can access the file. The clearest example of this condition is the Google site.

## Here's How the Cloud Works in Detail
To understand it further, it would be better if you understand how it works in detail. If you look at it, the way cloud storage works itself is not as complicated as imagined. The essence of how this actually works is related to file copying. When saving files on cloud storage, you are like copying the server.

But when it is copied on the server, the provider will give you full access. This access is entirely in your hands. The download process and changes to the file can be done as desired. In fact, the access of the file can also be expanded. This condition is usually done by business people.

With extended access, parties outside the uploader can also access. With that, the optimization of the file can be done by several people. For the sake of security, this media definitely does not only use one server. There are several servers that are used as storage.

The number of servers makes the possibility of bad things like file loss smaller. Most of the applications themselves do not require installation at an early stage. That's because, most of the applications can be accessed using the internet. How cloud storage works This will obviously benefit users more.

The absence of the installation process will make the space required becomes smaller. The most perfect form of application can probably be seen on google drive. This application allows someone to do full access to the uploaded files and even give access to others. If you already understand the benefits and meanings, be sure to use them in activities. By using it, you will certainly be very facilitated. The cost of buying storage media can also be minimized. Low costs and a very simple way of working cloud storage will definitely make it very easy.
