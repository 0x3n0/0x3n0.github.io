## why must understand Security Risk Assessment

Because this security hazard appraisal is the most important thing in a security hazard circle of the executives. Without something that is supported by information from security Hazard.

a quality evaluation will **produce a security plan** which of course will be far from being a perfect individualized organization. As a result, many security loopholes will be created.

## Security Risk Assessment Learning Objectives

1. Able to identify the forms of threats faced by the company, both from within (inside) and from outside (externally).

2. Able to identify and analyze vulnerabilities in protected resources.

Able to overcome and identify and analyze the security capabilities owned by the company today.

3.Able to analyze the security hazard (security hazard investigation) faced by the company.

4. Able to use Google Earth programming ideally in supporting security hazard evaluation activities.

5. Have sufficient knowledge about the negligible boundary in conducting security hazard appraisal.

6. Able to arrange security hazard evaluation agenda.

Able to organize and carry out security hazard evaluation activities in the field.

## Understanding Security Testing

Security testing is a type of testing towards software that is carried out to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that information and system resources in it are properly protected from intruders.

This test is conducted for the purpose of **finding all loopholes and system weaknesses** that may result in loss of information or the company's reputation.

Organization Security System: This test is conducted to look for vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure.

## Types or Types of Security Testing

1. Weakness Scanning

Weakness Scanning (vuln examine) is a security test that is done through automated programming to move web applications. This programming will look for security vulnerabilities in the system such as `Cross site prearranging`, `SQL Injection`, `Command Injection`, `Path Traversal`,

and insecure server configurations. This instrument is often referred to as part of Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).

## Vulnerability Scanning has several types of scanning, namely:

1. Outer weakness examines

Outer weakness examines are assessments for vulnerabilities carried out by **targeting an IT environment ecosystem** that is not restricted to interior use.

Scanning can focus on in several regions such as `applications`, `ports`, `sites`, `administrations`, `organizations`, and systems that can be accessed from outside by the client or client.

2. Interior weakness filters:

Inside weakness filters are scans that primarily target **enterprise inward networks**. scanning will identify a vulnerability in the network to avoid damage.

Scanning the inside also allows the company or organization to **protect and strengthen the security system** of the application from the inside.

2. Security checking

Security checking is a scan that is used to find vulnerabilities or unwanted document modifications in web-based applications, web sites, 'network', or 'system records'. This scan can be done by **automatically or manually**.

Scanning will provide a deep understanding impact and provide recommended solutions to fix problems found.

Security filtering that can be done as a one-time check or also a one-time check. software developers prefer **to perform regular security scans** to ensure the developed system is truly secure.

3. Entrance Testing

Entrance testing is expositions of testing by doing **simulation of digital attacks** on the system to be tested.

When testing on entrance testing is done, you will find various vulnerabilities that can be exploited by digital criminals.

Thus, the process of patching or repairing can be done immediately before the hackers find it.
Because programmers will continue to look for ways in an attempt to break into a victim's system**, this entrance testing needs to be done regularly.

1. Hazard Assessment

which have security risks faced by applications, programming, and networks that will be 'identified' and 'analyzed'. These security risks will also be classified into several categories, namely high, medium, and low.

some of these types of security testing can **help you ensure that the digital security controls** that you did previously are in accordance with the security risks facing your organization/company.

In general, **hazard evaluation** will be carried out by the company's inner IT team. IT teams that believe in conducting a risk assessment must thoroughly understand how your computerized and networked infrastructure works.

5. Security Auditing

Security Audit is a structured and method in which to evaluate the steps in security within the company.

By **performing a regular review**, you will certainly be helped in identifying weak points and vulnerabilities in a company's IT infrastructure, verifying security controls, ensuring compliance with security regulations, and much more.

6. Moral hacking

The moral of hacking is very closely related to **infiltration testing**. why this is so, you must understand that the scope of moral hacking is broader than infiltration testing.

The moral of this hacking is important because an in-test on security is carried out using all hacking techniques and apparatuses as well as other related computer attack techniques.

Expositions in the test can be done **by a moral programmer** who has received permission to explore the company's IT infrastructure in more detail.

The moral of the programmer is one to test how well it is at the security level by disrupting the system, using various vectors and also types of attacks.

With this test, you will be helped **to uncover** security vulnerabilities and weaknesses on a regular basis, the broader IT infrastructure of course.

7. Stance Assessment

Stance Assessment refers to a methodology which is carried out to **improve risk management capabilities within the company**.

Most and also many people consider this that act Assessment is a combination of several types of security testing aspects such as `Ethical Hacking`, `Security Scanning`, and `Risk Assessment`.

some of the things above, can be steps and **important steps to find out how a condition is in company security**.

You will have a clear view of the status of the company's security and also be able to identify impending security threats.

## Discussion on Security Risk Assessment Training:

1. Profile for Security

2. Security Risk Management

3. Danger Identification

4. Weakness Assessment

5. Capacity Assessment

6. Hazard Analysis and Control

7. Find out the Benefits of Google Earth

8. Boundary on Security Risk

## Conclusion
the following is the discussion that I have discussed above how important it is to understand the risk **What Is Security Risk Assessment Physical Security** in the company, so that we know what things must be evaluated to keep the company running well

keep obeying the rules and also keep your distance, and don't of course forget to wear a mask.
