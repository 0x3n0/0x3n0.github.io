## What is DNS Poisoning
Maybe the term from **DNS Poisoning** is still not widely known. But for those people who are always involved in 'information

technology', or 'DNS world' or the web, they are certainly not surprised by this term. **DNS Poisoning** or another name which is also called **DNS Cache Poisoning**

a method used to penetrate, defense into a system by **entering an incorrect IP address** associated with a **host**. What's the goal? The purpose of DNS Poisoning is to **redirect a packet traffic** from reaching its original destination.

Many crackers, pentesters out there **use DNS Poisoning** with the aim that they can penetrate various sites such as e-commerce, banks or organizations which can now be done online via the internet, using **security tokens** .

DNS Poisoning will allow a **fake server** to appear that has an exact appearance or glimpse of the real server.

Therefore, it takes a **digital certificate** in order to secure it. So, the fake server will not be able to retrieve data related to **authentication** that comes from **customers** who access the server.

In conclusion, the way DNS Poisoning works is by **faking the DNS address of the original server** so that internet users can or are tricked and then enter the site or the fake server.

For ordinary people, it will be difficult to distinguish which server is fake or genuine because it looks really similar, similar. But for those who are `experienced`, they tend to easily guess which one is the `real server` and which is the `fake server`.

## Dangers of DNS Poisoning Impact
DNS Poisoning is a very **dangerous** action and must be addressed and evaluated immediately. Just imagine if many people access a **fake server** and then **provide information** related to **personal data** or even provide information about `account number`, `phone number` and `password`.
## The impact of DNS Poisoning that needs to be considered

1. Can manipulate banking sites
The first danger caused by DNS Poisoning is that they can easily manipulate the addresses of banking sites. Users will not be aware that they will say that they are **accessing the official site** of the bank where they make transactions

But in fact, when they typed on the bank's site, it turned out that the user was taken to another or fake site which was **ready to steal** various and varied **important data** on the victim.

Can you imagine for yourself if it turns out that the perpetrator of DNS Poisoning can access **all important information** not only from one person, but from **many people**.

How much loss will occur which of course we really have to prevent and evaluate it.

2. DNS Poisoning can spread to various internet service providers. The second danger with **the existence of DNS Poisoning** is that it turns out that DNS has been poisoned and can spread.
   
For example, when several internet service providers find out that they are already involved in **DNS Poisoning**. then the entry from the DNS Poisoning will enter the internet service provider and be stored there. Next, the data entry will enter the home router.

When the victim **can access** or can connect to the internet, then DNS Poisoning will be able to start working by observing every activity carried out by the victim. Including when the victim types in a `username` or `password` when logging in on social media or entering an email.

## How to Avoid DNS Poisoning Attacks

Then how to **avoid DNS Poisoning attacks** There are several actions you can take to prevent or anticipate you from the dangers of DNS Poisoning. That way, you don't fall into a **fake server** and your data won't be taken by the fake server either.

1. Perform computer port monitoring audit
The first thing you can do is to do a technique, monitoring the **ports installed** on the computer.

You can also perform an **analysis of the IP** by matching the `destination web address` with the `server ip`. Don't worry, for those of you who use the Windows operating system, you can immediately do this first method.

You can easily find out where your network is connected. The way you have to do is go into cmd and then **you type** `netstat`. Then you type in `net stat-in` and you can **get information regarding the IP on the server and also the destination web**.

2. Take advantage of firewalls
Firewall is also one of the things that must be considered when you enter a web page. **The function of the firewall** is to **detect connections** from or to the computer. Although sometimes the firewall system asks for confirmation which takes a long time.

However, you still have to go through this process, make sure your firewall is always active, so that later you can **get maximum security** for the security of your **data**.

3. Monitoring the hosts file
You can also avoid DNS Poisoning by doing a **monitoring of the hosts file** on the computer.

The host location is `c:\windows\system 32\drivers\etc\hosts`. You can use a text editor such as `notepad`, `sublime text` or `word` to be able to open and also see the **contents of the hosts file**.

## Conclusion

That's the explanation of things about dns can that we provide regarding the understanding, dangers, and also how to **avoid DNS Poisoning**, what we can take is DNS Poisoning is an action that is **very dangerous** that can give ** great loss** for the victims.

I hope it is useful to keep `wearing a mask` and `always exercising`, because that is the `organic healthy` way
