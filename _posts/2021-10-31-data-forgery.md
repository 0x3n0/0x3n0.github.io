Data Forgery is a **crime by falsifying data on important documents** stored as scripless documents via the Internet.

This crime in case usually directed at e-commerce documents by making it appear as if there was a **typo**.

which in the end will benefit the perpetrators because the victim will enter **personal data** such as 'credit card number' and other 'personal data' which could be misused by irresponsible parties.

## Examples of Cases in Data Forgery

1. Data Forgery in BCA E-Banking

The world of banking via the Internet (e-banking) in Indonesia, was shocked by the actions of a person named Steven Haryanto, a hacker and journalist at Master Web magazine. he This man from Bandung deliberately **created a genuine but fake website** Bank Central Asia's Internet banking service.

Steven bought domains with similar names such as: `http://www.klikbca.com` **original site for BCA Internet banking**, namely the domain `http://www.klik-bca.com,` `www. kilkbca.com`, `http://www.clikbca.com`, `http://www.klickca.com`. And `http://www.klikbac.com`. The contents of these sites are almost the same **, except that there is no security for transactions and a form, namely **fake login form access**.

If a BCA customer **mistypes the original BCA website**, then the customer is in the trap of a prank site created by Steven so that the identity of `user of user rid` and `personal identity number of PIN` can be known.

## Performed Mode
The mode is very simple, from the cracker **photocopying the appearance of the BCA website page** which **as if belongs to BCA** This action is taken to deceive the customer so that the perpetrator can take the customer's identity.

Another mode that also uses fake sites is fraud through certain sites.

What ever happened was that a Triple X porn site made an offer, **if you want to enter and see exciting pictures** that can increase your adrenaline, please register and transfer a fee of Rp. 10,000, - via BCA.

## Internet Domain Buyer Mistyped Following:

1. WWWCLICKCA.COM

2. KILKBCA.COM

3. CLIKBCA.COM

4. KLICKBCA.COM

5. KlikBAC.COM

Through this letter, I personally and in writing express my deepest apologies. I regret and acknowledge that I have caused losses to BCA and the customer** who happened to enter the fake site.

But I guarantee that I never and **will not misuse the data**. With this, I also submit user data to BCA. To the best of my knowledge, this data has never leaked into third hands and is only stored in encrypted form on the hard drive of my personal computer. Please BCA immediately follow up on this data.

Hereby I also want to explain, namely that this act departed from **just curiosity**, to find out how many people actually entered the play site. **There is no criminal motive at all**.

The real reason, I even posted my real name and address on the domain, and not a fake address. Because since the beginning of my purchase I did not intend to steal money from the customer's account**.

I have never broken into, breached, or tried to break into the network or security systems of **BCA/Internet Banking BCA**. Instead, what I did was to buy some mock domains with my own money, and copy the index page and the `http://www.klikbca.com` login page into another server. It was still a mistake, for me to admit.

I have never copied the logo on KlikBCA or changed it. All files for fake sites, come from the original server at http://www.klikbca.com/. that the user sees, except for the **front page file** and the login page on the

I really hope what I have done is MORE POSITIVE THAN NEGATIVE IMPACT. Users can be exposed to the problem and become more aware of this security issue.

"Security in layers. 128 bit SSL… Certified by Verisign…Firewall to restrict access… Userid and PIN.” Does someone have to invent an advanced technology, hire the best hackers, break through all that security technology to be able to **gain access to user accounts**? No. All you need is 8 USD. Ironic indeed.

**TYPO SITE** problem is a common problem with domain.com/.net/.org which can't be avoided (we can take a look at **database on whois** to see how many prank domains are being bought by third parties ). Incidentally in my experiment this is on KlikBCA.

All online sites can actually be threatened by this problem, namely the problem of **typing wrong domain purchase**. Currently, I myself have been/will continue to try to clarify this issue to the general public and do not intend to harm BCA or its customers at all.

**All spoofed domains will be handed over to BCA** without the need for BCA to reimburse the registration fee. I didn't expect it to be worth the harm I might have caused, but just to show my 'remorse' and 'my apologies'.

## Forgery Data Countermeasures

The common features of data forgery cases such as phishing email cases are to pay attention to `subject` and `content`, partly as follows:

1. Verify your Account
If the verify asks for `username`, `password` and `other data`, don't react back. You must **always remember your password** never give it to anyone.

But if you **register an account on a site** and have to verify it by clicking on a certain URL **without asking to send any data**, just do it, because this is a common mechanism.

"If you don't respond within 48 hours, your account will be closed."

Please read carefully and there is no need to rush. You must pay attention to the article above because it is generally only a provocation so that readers will panic more.

1. Valued Customers
Because phishing e-mails are usually targeted at random, they can use these words. But someday it may be **using our name directly**, so you have to be careful. Generally name leaks because we are active on a particular mailing list or community forum.

## Global Countermeasures

1. Modernizing the national criminal law and its procedural law.

2. Improve the security system in the national computer network **according to international standards**.

3. Improve an understanding and expertise in law enforcement apparatus regarding **prevention efforts**, investigation and prosecution of cases **related to cybercrime**.

4. Raise awareness among citizens **about cybercrime** and the importance of preventing such crimes from occurring.

5. Increasing cooperation between countries, both 'bilateral', 'regional' and 'multilateral', in efforts to deal with cybercrime.
Need for Special Institution Support

## How to Prevent Data Forgery from Occurring
There are several ways to prevent this crime from happening, as follows:

1. There needs to be a cyber law, namely a law that specifically handles cyber crimes that occur on the internet. because this crime is different from a **conventional crime**.
   
2. The need for more intensive socialization or education to the community that can be carried out by special institutions.

3. Web providers that store important data are expected to use **encryption to increase security**.
   
4. Users are also expected to be more vigilant and careful before **entering their data on the internet**, considering that this crime often occurs because of the user's lack of accuracy.
