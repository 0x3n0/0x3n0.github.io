![img-description](/assets/img/wifi/wifi-manager.webp)_WiFi Interfaces Management_

Wi-Fi interfaces, also known as wireless interfaces, are hardware devices that allow a computer or other device to connect to a wireless network. These interfaces are typically built into laptops, smartphones, and other devices, but they can also be added to a device as an external adapter.

There are several tools and commands that can be used to manage Wi-Fi interfaces on a Linux system

```
ip link show
iwconfig
```
`ip link show` is a command used in Linux to display information about the network interfaces on a system. It can be used to show the status, MAC address, and other details of each interface.

Here is an example of the output of `ip link show`:

```bash
$ ip link show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:77:88:99:aa:bb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

In this example, there are three network interfaces: `lo` (the loopback interface), `eth0` (an Ethernet interface), and `wlan0` (a wireless interface). The output shows the status, MAC address, and other details for each interface.

`iwconfig` is a command used in Linux to configure the parameters of a wireless network interface. It can be used to set the ESSID, channel, frequency, and other parameters of the interface.

Here is an example of the output of `iwconfig`:

```bash
$ iwconfig
wlan0     IEEE 802.11  ESSID:"my_network"  
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.462 GHz  Access Point: 00:11:22:33:44:55   
          Bit Rate=54 Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm   
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:on
          Link Quality=70/70  Signal level=-35 dBm  
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0
```
In this example, the interface `wlan0` is connected to a wireless network with the ESSID "my_network", and is operating in managed mode (as an STA). The frequency, access point, bit rate, and other parameters are also shown.

## Check Channels Supported by WiFi card
```
iwlist chan
iwlist <interface> chan
```

`iwlist chan` is a command used in Linux to list the available channels on a wireless network interface. It can be used to see which channels are currently being used by the interface, as well as the frequency and maximum bandwidth of each channel.

Here is an example of the output of `iwlist chan`:

```bash
$ iwlist chan
wlan0     13 channels in total; available frequencies :
          Channel 01 : 2.412 GHz
          Channel 02 : 2.417 GHz
          Channel 03 : 2.422 GHz
          Channel 04 : 2.427 GHz
          Channel 05 : 2.432 GHz
          Channel 06 : 2.437 GHz
          Channel 07 : 2.442 GHz
          Channel 08 : 2.447 GHz
          Channel 09 : 2.452 GHz
          Channel 10 : 2.457 GHz
          Channel 11 : 2.462 GHz
          Channel 12 : 2.467 GHz
          Channel 13 : 2.472 GHz
```
In this example, the interface wlan0 has 13 available channels, each with a specific frequency.

You can also specify a specific interface to list the available channels for that interface. For example, `iwlist wlan0 chan` will show the available channels for the interface `wlan0`.

## Get Full Technical Info about Device

### Get info such as:

- Supported channels/frequencies
- Supported bandwidths
- Supported interface modes (e.g. AP, monitor...)

To get technical info about all WiFi interfaces:

```
iw list
```

There are a few different ways you can get information about the supported channels, frequencies, bandwidths, and interface modes of a wireless network interface on a Linux system:

- `iw lis`t: This command displays a wealth of information about the capabilities of a wireless interface, including the supported channels and frequencies, supported bandwidths, and supported interface modes (such as AP, monitor, and managed).

- `iw phy`: This command displays information about the physical layer (PHY) of a wireless interface, including the supported channels and frequencies, supported bandwidths, and supported interface modes.

- `iw dev`: This command displays information about the wireless interfaces on a system, including the supported channels and frequencies, supported bandwidths, and supported interface modes.

### Here is an example of the output of `iw list`:

```bash
$ iw list
Wiphy phy0
        max # scan SSIDs: 4
        max scan IEs length: 2257 bytes
        Retry short limit: 7
        Retry long limit: 4
        Coverage class: 0 (up to 0m)
        Available Antennas: TX 0 RX 0
        Supported interface modes:
                 * IBSS
                 * managed
                 * AP

                        RX HT20 SGI
                        RX HT40 SGI
                        No RX STBC
                        Max AMSDU length: 3839 bytes
                        No DSSS/CCK HT40
                Maximum RX AMPDU length 65535 bytes (exponent: 0x003)
                Minimum RX AMPDU time spacing: 8 usec (0x06)
                HT RX MCS rate indexes supported: 0-23
                HT TX MCS rate indexes are undefined
        Band 3:
                Capabilities: 0x1021
                        HT20
                        SM Power Save disabled
                        RX HT20 SGI
                        No RX STBC
                        Max AMSDU length: 3839 bytes
                        No DSSS/CCK HT40
                Maximum RX AMPDU length 65535 bytes (exponent: 0x003)
                Minimum RX AMPDU time spacing: 8 usec (0x06)
                HT RX MCS rate indexes supported: 0-23
                HT TX MCS rate indexes are undefined
```
In this example, the interface supports multiple bands (1, 2, and 3) and has a range of capabilities, including support for HT20/HT40, SM power save, RX HT20/HT40 SGI, and various MCS rate indexes. It also supports several interface modes, including IBSS, managed, AP, AP/VLAN, WDS, and monitor.

You can also specify a specific interface to list the capabilities of that interface. For example

```
iw dev # to get phy# value
iw phy phy<value> info # value is 0, 1, 2...
```

iw dev is a command used in Linux to display information about the wireless interfaces on a system. It can be used to show the status, MAC address, and other details of each interface.

Here is an example of the output of iw dev

```bash
$ iw dev
phy#0
        Interface wlan0
                ifindex 3
                wdev 0x1
                addr 00:11:22:33:44:55
                type managed
        Interface wlan1
                ifindex 4
                wdev 0x2
                addr 66:77:88:99:aa:bb
                type AP
```
In this example, there are two wireless interfaces on the system: wlan0 (a managed interface) and wlan1 (an AP interface). The output shows the interface name, index, MAC address, and type for each interface.

The iw phy command is used to display information about the physical layer (PHY) of a wireless interface. You can use it to get the phy# value of an interface by specifying the interface name as an argument. For example, iw dev wlan0 phy will display the phy# value of the interface wlan0.

Once you have the phy# value, you can use it with the iw phy command to display more detailed information about the PHY. For example, iw phy phy<value> info will display information about the PHY with the specified value.

Here is an example of the output of iw phy phy0 info:

```bash
$ iw phy phy0 info
Wiphy phy0
        max # scan SSIDs: 4
        max scan IEs length: 2257 bytes
        Retry short limit: 7
        Retry long limit: 4
        Coverage class: 0 (up to 0m)
        Available Antennas: TX 0 RX 0
        Supported interface modes:
                 * IBSS
                 * managed
                 * AP
                 * AP/VLAN
                 * WDS
                 * monitor
        Band 1:
                Capabilities: 0x10a1
                        HT20/HT40
                        SM Power Save disabled
                        RX HT20 SGI
                        RX HT40 SGI
                        No RX STBC
                        Max AMSDU length: 3839 bytes
                        No DSSS/CCK HT40
                Maximum RX AMPDU length 65535 bytes (exponent: 0x003)
                Minimum RX AMPDU time spacing: 8 usec (0x06)
                HT RX MCS rate indexes supported: 0-23
                HT TX MCS rate indexes are undefined

                        SM Power Save disabled
                        RX HT20 SGI
                        RX HT40 SGI
                        No RX STBC

## Increase WiFi TX Power

Does not work on every WiFi card
```
iw reg set B0  # Set regulatory domain to Bolivia
iwconfig wlan0 txpower 30  # Put interface TX Power to 30 Dbm
```

If returns an error, try second method:
```
ifconfig wlan0 down
iw reg set BO
ifconfig wlan0 up
iwconfig wlan0 channel 13
iwconfig wlan0 txpower 30
```

The iw reg set command is used to set the regulatory domain of a wireless interface on a Linux system. The regulatory domain determines the rules and regulations that apply to the operation of the interface in a specific geographic region. It can affect the available channels, frequencies, and other parameters of the interface.

The iwconfig command is used to configure the parameters of a wireless interface, such as the ESSID, channel, frequency, and transmit power.

In the first example you provided, the regulatory domain is being set to Bolivia (B0) and the transmit power of the interface wlan0 is being set to 30 dBm. If this command returns an error, it may be because the wireless interface does not support changing the regulatory domain or transmit power.

In the second example, the regulatory domain is being set to Bolivia (BO) and the channel and transmit power of the interface wlan0 are being set to 13 and 30 dBm, respectively. This method involves bringing the interface down and then back up again, which may help to reset any conflicting settings and allow the changes to take effect.

It's worth noting that not all wireless interfaces support changing the regulatory domain or transmit power, and some may require additional configuration or drivers to enable these features. Additionally, the rules and regulations for wireless operation can vary by country, so it's important to make sure you are using the correct regulatory domain for your location.

### Alternative method:
```
iw wlan0 set txpower fixed 3000
```
The iw command is a tool used to configure and manage wireless interfaces on a Linux system. It can be used to set various parameters of a wireless interface, including the transmit power.

In the example you provided, the iw command is being used to set the transmit power of the interface wlan0 to a fixed value of 3000 mW (3 W). The transmit power is expressed in milliwatts (mW) and can be converted to decibels milliwatts (dBm) using the formula dBm = 10 * log10(mW). In this case, a transmit power of 3000 mW is equivalent to approximately 33 dBm.

It's worth noting that not all wireless interfaces support changing the transmit power, and some may require additional configuration or drivers to enable this feature. Additionally, the rules and regulations for wireless operation can vary by country, so it's important to make sure you are using the correct transmit power for your location.

## Set Interface in Monitor Mode

### Manual method:
```
iw dev wlan0 interface add mon0 type monitor
ifconfig mon0 up
iw dev mon0 set channel <channel>  # Set the interface on a specific channel
iw dev mon0 info  # Check interface status
```
In the example you provided, the iw and ifconfig commands are being used to set the wireless interface wlan0 in monitor mode. Monitor mode allows a wireless interface to passively listen to all traffic on a given channel, without participating in the network as a client or access point.

The first command, iw dev wlan0 interface add mon0 type monitor, creates a new interface called mon0 and sets it to monitor mode. The ifconfig command is then used to bring the interface up, making it active and ready to receive traffic.

The iw dev mon0 set channel command is used to set the channel of the monitor interface to a specific value. This allows the interface to listen to traffic on that particular channel.

Finally, the iw dev mon0 info command is used to check the status of the monitor interface. This can be used to confirm that the interface is in monitor mode and on the correct channel.

Monitor mode is useful for capturing wireless traffic for analysis or debugging purposes, but it can also be used for malicious purposes such as eavesdropping on wireless communications. It is important to use monitor mode responsibly and with appropriate authorization.

### Automatic method:
```
airmon-ng start wlan0
```
airmon-ng is a tool from the Aircrack-ng suite, a set of tools used for wireless security and analysis. The airmon-ng start command is used to set a wireless interface in monitor mode.

In the example you provided, the command airmon-ng start wlan0 is used to set the interface wlan0 in monitor mode. This command will bring the interface down, set it to monitor mode, and bring it back up again, all in a single step.

Note: In some cases, some processes (e.g. NetworkManager, wpa_supplicant) might
interfere with other tools from aircrack-ng suite. They can be all killed using:
```
airmon-ng check kill
```

In some cases, other processes such as NetworkManager or wpa_supplicant may interfere with the operation of airmon-ng and other tools from the Aircrack-ng suite. To address this, the airmon-ng check kill command can be used to check for and kill these processes if necessary.
  
### Delete interface in monitor mode:
```
iw dev wlan0 del
```

To delete a monitor interface created with airmon-ng start, you can use the iw dev command with the del option, as shown in the example: iw dev wlan0 del. This will delete the monitor interface and restore the original wireless interface to its normal operation.

It's worth noting that monitor mode is a powerful and potentially risky feature, and it is important to use it responsibly and with appropriate authorization. It is also important to be aware of the rules and regulations that apply to wireless operation in your location.

## List Devices in Monitor Mode

```
iwconfig | grep -i monitor
```
The iwconfig command is a tool used to configure and display information about wireless interfaces on a Linux system. When used with the grep command, it can be used to list the wireless interfaces that are currently in monitor mode.

In the example you provided, iwconfig is used to display information about all wireless interfaces on the system, and the output is piped to grep, which searches for the string monitor (case-insensitive). Any interfaces that include the word "monitor" in their output will be displayed on the screen.

Here is an example of the output of this command:

```
$ iwconfig | grep -i monitor
mon0     IEEE 802.11  Mode:Monitor  Tx-Power=20 dBm
```

In this example, there is one wireless interface in monitor mode: mon0. The output shows the name of the interface, the protocol (IEEE 802.11), the mode (Monitor), and the transmit power.

This command can be useful for quickly checking which wireless interfaces are in monitor mode, as well as their current settings. However, it is important to note that this command will only display interfaces that are currently up and active. If an interface is down or inactive, it will not be included in the output.

## Test Card is Working Well in Monitor Mode

```bash
airodump-ng wlan1 --band ag -M -U --wps --beacons -w captureallthewireless
# --band a for 5Ghz
# --band g for 2.4 GHz

#ifconfig wlan0
#aireplay-ng wlan0 -9
10:09:24 Trying broadcast probe requests..

`--band <abg>`: 'b' and 'g' uses 2.4GHz and 'a' uses 5GHz
```

airodump-ng is a tool from the Aircrack-ng suite, a set of tools used for wireless security and analysis. It can be used to capture wireless traffic and display information about wireless networks in the area.

In the example you provided, airodump-ng is being used to capture wireless traffic on the interface wlan1 and save it to a file called captureallthewireless. The --band option is used to specify the frequency band to capture: a for 5 GHz, b for 2.4 GHz, or g for 2.4 GHz. The --wps and --beacons options are used to include information about WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) and beacon frames in the capture file. The -M and -U options are used to enable "Mixed" and "Unassociated" mode, which allow the tool to capture traffic from all networks, regardless of whether they are associated with the interface.

The aireplay-ng command is also from the Aircrack-ng suite and is used to send wireless frames to a wireless network. In this example, the command aireplay-ng wlan0 -9 is being used to send broadcast probe requests to the interface `

## Injection Test

### Test if WiFi device can perform injection:
```
aireplay-ng -9 mon0
aireplay-ng -9 -i mon0 mon1  # Attack (replay) tests (with 2 wifi cards in monitor mode)
```

aireplay-ng is a tool from the Aircrack-ng suite, a set of tools used for wireless security and analysis. It can be used to send wireless frames to a wireless network, or to replay captured frames back to a network.

In the examples you provided, aireplay-ng is being used to test the injection capabilities of a wireless interface. The -9 option specifies the type of attack to use: broadcast probe request replay. This attack sends a series of broadcast probe requests to the target network, which can be used to test the injection capabilities of the interface.

In the first example, aireplay-ng -9 mon0 is used to perform the injection test on the interface mon0. In the second example, aireplay-ng -9 -i mon0 mon1 is used to perform the same test, but with two interfaces in monitor mode: mon0 and mon1.

It's worth noting that injection tests can be used for legitimate purposes, such as testing the performance of a wireless interface or debugging network issues. However, they can also be used for malicious purposes, such as disrupting the operation of a wireless network or injecting malicious traffic. It is important to use these tools responsibly and with appropriate authorization.

## Control Channel & Bandwidth of Interface in Monitor Mode

### Check interface channel & frequency info:
```
iw dev wlan0 info | grep channel
```

The command iw dev wlan0 info displays information about the wireless device named "wlan0", including the frequency of the channel that the device is currently using.

The grep command is used to filter the output of the iw command, so that only the lines containing the word "channel" are displayed.

For example, if the device is currently connected to a wireless network on channel 6, the output of the command might look like this:

```
channel 6 (2437 MHz)
```
This indicates that the device is using a frequency of 2437 MHz (which corresponds to channel 6 in the 2.4 GHz band).

You can use this command to get information about the channel and frequency that your wireless device is using, which can be helpful for troubleshooting or for understanding the wireless environment in which your device is operating.

### Set interface to specific channel & to bandwidth = 40MHz:
```
iw dev wlan0 set channel <channel_number> HT40+
iw dev wlan0 set channel <channel_number> HT40-
```

The iw command can be used to set the channel and bandwidth of a wireless interface, such as "wlan0".

To set the interface to a specific channel, you can use the iw dev wlan0 set channel command followed by the desired channel number. For example, to set the interface to channel 6, you can use the following command:

```
iw dev wlan0 set channel 6
```
To set the bandwidth of the interface to 40 MHz, you can use the HT40+ or HT40- option. The HT40+ option specifies that the interface should use the upper 20 MHz of the channel, while the HT40- option specifies that the interface should use the lower 20 MHz of the channel.

### For example, to set the interface to use the upper 20 MHz of channel 6, you can use the following command:

```
iw dev wlan0 set channel 6 HT40+
```
Or, to set the interface to use the lower 20 MHz of channel 6, you can use the following command:

```
iw dev wlan0 set channel 6 HT40-
```
Note that these commands only change the configuration of the wireless interface, and they do not necessarily cause the interface to connect to a wireless network. To connect to a wireless network, you may need to use additional commands, such as wpa_supplicant or nmcli, depending on your network setup.

Change interface channel
```
iwconfig <interface> channel <channel_number>
```

The iwconfig command is used to configure wireless interfaces on Linux systems.

To change the channel of a wireless interface using iwconfig, you can use the channel option followed by the desired channel number. For example, to change the channel of the interface `wlan0` to 6, you can use the following command:

```
iwconfig wlan0 channel 6
```
Note that the iwconfig command is deprecated and has been replaced by the iw command in recent versions of Linux. It is recommended to use the iw command instead of iwconfig for configuring wireless interfaces.

To change the channel of a wireless interface using iw, you can use the iw dev <interface> set channel command, followed by the desired channel number. For example:

```
iw dev wlan0 set channel 6
```
This will change the channel of the interface "wlan0" to 6.

As with the iwconfig command, changing the channel of a wireless interface using iw does not necessarily cause the interface to connect to a wireless network. To connect to a wireless network, you may need to use additional commands, such as wpa_supplicant or nmcli, depending on your network setup.

## Scan for WiFi Networks (Active Scanning)

```
iw dev
ip link show wlan0
ip link set wlan0 up
iw wlan0 link
iw wlan0 scan
iw wlan0 scan | grep "SSID:"  # Clean output of SSIDs
iw dev wlan0 scan | grep "^BSS\|SSID\|WSP\|Authentication\|WPS\|WPA"
```
The `iw dev` command is used to display information about wireless devices on the system. It can be used to show the available wireless interfaces, their settings, and the wireless networks they are connected to.

### An example of using iw dev might be:

```bash
$ iw dev
phy#0
    Interface wlan0
        ifindex 3
        wdev 0x1
        addr 00:11:22:33:44:55
        type managed
        channel 1 (2412 MHz), width: 20 MHz, center1: 2412 MHz
```

The `ip link show wlan0` command is used to display information about the specific wireless interface "wlan0". This can include the interface's MAC address, state (up or down), and other details.

### An example of using ip link show wlan0 might be:

```bash
$ ip link show wlan0
3: wlan0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state DOWN mode DORMANT qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

The `ip link set wlan0 up` command is used to bring up the `wlan0` wireless interface. This means that the interface will be activated and made available for use.

### An example of using ip link set wlan0 up might be:

```bash
$ ip link set wlan0 up
$ ip link show wlan0
3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DORMANT qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

The `iw wlan0 link` command is used to show information about the wireless link (connection) for the `wlan0` interface. This can include the wireless network's MAC address, signal strength, and other details.

### An example of using iw wlan0 link might be:

```bash
$ iw wlan0 link
Connected to 00:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee (on wlan0)
    SSID: MyWirelessNetwork
    freq: 2412
    RX: 12345 bytes (123 packets)
    TX: 6789 bytes (67 packets)
    signal: -65 dBm
    tx bitrate: 1.0 MBit/s
    bss flags:  short-preamble short-slot-time
    dtim period:    2
    beacon int: 100
```

The `iw wlan0 scan` command is used to scan for available wireless networks in the area. This can be used to find networks to connect to, or to get information about the wireless networks in the area.

### An example of using iw wlan0 scan might be:

```bash
$ iw wlan0 scan
BSS 00:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee (on wlan0)
    SSID: MyWirelessNetwork
    freq: 2412
    beacon interval: 100
    signal: -65 dBm
    WPS:   supported
    WPA:   supported
    WPA
```

## Connect to Open WiFi Network (unsecured)

```
iwconfig wlan0 essid <SSID>
ifconfig wlan0 up
dhclient -v wlan0
```
The `iwconfig wlan0 essid <SSID>` command is used to connect the `wlan0` wireless interface to a specific wireless network with the given SSID (network name).

### using iwconfig wlan0 essid <SSID> might be:

```bash
$ iwconfig wlan0 essid MyWirelessNetwork
$ iwconfig wlan0
wlan0     IEEE 802.11  ESSID:"MyWirelessNetwork"  
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Access Point: 00:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee   
          Bit Rate=1 Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm   
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:on
          Link Quality=70/70  Signal level=-60 dBm  
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0
```
The `ifconfig wlan0 up` command is used to bring up the "wlan0" wireless interface. This means that the interface will be activated and made available for use.

### using `ifconfig wlan0 up` might be:

```bash
$ ifconfig wlan0 up
$ ifconfig wlan0
wlan0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet6 fe80::211:22ff:fe33:4455  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 00:11:22:33:44:55  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 123  bytes 123456 (123.4 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 67  bytes 67890 (67.8 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

The `dhclient -v wlan0` command is used to obtain an IP address for the "wlan0" wireless interface from a DHCP server. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol used by network devices to automatically obtain network settings such as an IP address, gateway, and DNS servers.

### using `dhclient -v wlan0` might be:
```bash
$ dhclient -v wlan0
Listening on LPF/wlan0/00:11:22:33:44:55
Sending on   LPF/wlan0/00:11:22:33:44:55
Sending on   Socket/fallback
DHCPREQUEST on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67
DHCPACK from 192.168.1.1
bound to 192.168.1.100 -- renewal in 35999 seconds.
```
This would connect the "wlan0" wireless interface to an open (unsecured) wireless network with the SSID "MyWirelessNetwork", bring up the interface, and obtain an IP address from a DHCP server.
