My name is Eno and I am a penetration tester and security researcher. I have a wide range of skills and expertise in the field of cybersecurity, including networking, web applications, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing. I am also well-versed in various Red Team attack vectors, which allows me to effectively simulate and test the defenses of a target system or network.

As a penetration tester, it is my job to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a system or network in order to assess its security posture. I use a variety of tools and techniques to accomplish this, including manual testing, automated scanning, and social engineering. In addition to identifying vulnerabilities, I also work to provide recommendations on how to fix them and improve the overall security of the system.

As a security researcher, I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date on the latest threats and trends in the cybersecurity industry. I also contribute to the community by publishing research papers.
