I'm an Information Security Enthusiast, And want to be a Red Teamer. I have been with InfoSec since 2019. I have experience in Active Directory, Web Applications, Network Penetration Testing, VAPT and Multiple Red Team Attack Vectors. I sharpen my skills on Hackthebox and I write active/retired engine posts on my blog. I'm a member of the synack red team and do Bug Hunting on their platform. I have completed two hackthebox labs Pro Rastalabs and Offshore. And I am actively looking for any opportunity in InfoSec Field for Red Team / Penetration Testing role. I have been a state level Cricketer in my past
